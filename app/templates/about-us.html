      <p class="about-intro">
        At Mind Body Soul Doula Care, we believe pregnancy, childbirth, and parenthood
        touch every part of a woman’s being — mind, body, and soul. Just as the body
        prepares for birth, the mind and spirit deserve nurturing, reassurance, and steady
        support throughout this transformative season of life.
      </p>

      <h2 class='philosophy-title'> Our Philosophy </h2>
      <!-- Intro paragraph: Lato, Warm Taupe, slightly increased line spacing -->
      <p class="about-philosophy">
      We believe true support honors the whole woman.
      The <span class="hl">mind</span> deserves calm, clarity, and informed guidance.
      The <span class="hl">body</span> deserves respect, trust, and evidence-based care.
      The <span class="hl">soul</span> deserves presence, compassion, and space to unfold.
	When these are supported together, women step into birth and motherhood feeling empowered
	rather than overwhelmed — confident rather than uncertain.
	You are not a task to manage or a birth plan to control.
	You are a whole person moving through a sacred transition.
	Our mother–daughter team we will walk beside you with knowledge, steadiness, and heart.
      </p>
