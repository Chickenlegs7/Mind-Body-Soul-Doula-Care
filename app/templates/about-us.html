        When these are supported together, women step into birth and motherhood feeling empowered rather than
        overwhelmed — confident rather than uncertain.
      </p>

      <p class="about-paragraph">
        You are not a task to manage or a birth plan to control.<br />
        You are a whole person moving through a sacred transition.

        As a mother–daughter team, we walk beside you with knowledge, steadiness, and heart.

          Birth does not happen in isolation.<br />
          It echoes beyond a single moment — shaping mothers, families, and generations to come.
        </p>

        <p>
          The way a woman is supported in pregnancy and birth influences not only her experience, but the foundation
          of her family and the stories carried forward.

          We believe birth is generational. Support should be, too.
