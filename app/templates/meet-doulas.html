            <p>Birth has shaped my life in more ways than I can count.</p>

            <p>
              As the mother of nine, I have experienced firsthand the strength, vulnerability, and
              transformation that pregnancy and birth bring. Each of my own births taught me something new
              — about surrender, resilience, trust, and the remarkable capacity of a woman’s body. Those
              experiences ignited in me a deep love for supporting other women as they step into
              motherhood.
            </p>

            <p>
              For over twenty-five years, I have walked alongside women in this sacred season — offering
              encouragement, perspective, and steady presence. As my children grew and began leaving
              home, I felt called to devote myself more fully to this work. I completed my formal doula training
              and began Mind, Body, Soul Doula alongside my youngest daughter.
            </p>

            <p>
              Birth is not simply a physical event — it touches a woman’s mind, her body, and her soul. My
              heart is to ensure that every woman feels seen, informed, respected, and empowered
              throughout this profound transition.

            <p>
              Growing up in a large family, babies and motherhood were woven into the rhythm of my life.
              From a young age, I developed a deep appreciation for the beauty and strength found in this
              season.
            </p>

            <p>
              As I support women now, I do so with both tenderness and intention — always learning, always
              listening. I understand that pregnancy and birth can hold both joy and uncertainty, and I value
              being a steady, reassuring presence during this transformative time.
            </p>

            <p>
              I am currently training as a full-spectrum doula and have a particular interest in nutrition that
              strengthens and prepares the body for pregnancy and childbirth. I believe that when a woman
              feels informed in her mind, supported in her body, and steady in her spirit, she can approach
              birth with greater peace and confidence.
